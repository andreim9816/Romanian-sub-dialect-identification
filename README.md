# Romanian-sub-dialect-identification
Discriminate between the Moldavian and the Romanian dialects across different text genres (news versus tweets).
In the Romanian Dialect Identification (RDI) shared task, participants have to train a model on samples collected the news domain and evaluate it on tweets. Therefore, participants
have to build a model for a cross-genre binary classification by dialect task, in which a classification model is required to discriminate between the Moldavian (MD) and the
Romanian (RO) dialects across different text genres (news versus tweets)
